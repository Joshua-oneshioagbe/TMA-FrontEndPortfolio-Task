    <h2>My Journey so far</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Early Beginnings: My journey started with simple HTML and CSS projects. I was immediately captivated by the power of these languages to shape the online world. It wasn't long before I delved into JavaScript, unlocking the ability to make websites
            interactive and dynamic.
        </li>
        <li>Continuous Learning: I'm a firm believer in lifelong learning. I am dedicating hours to online courses, tutorials, and documentation to stay up-to-date with the latest front-end frameworks and libraries. I hope to learn framworks including React,
            Vue.js, and more. Learning is an ongoing adventure, and I embrace it with enthusiasm.</li>
